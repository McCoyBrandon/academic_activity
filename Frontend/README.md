Product Description:
The goal of this product would be to create a task tracking tool that could be used for helping individual students and/or researchers manage their scholarly work and to retain the activities to create an academic portfolio.  It could also act as a reference engine to assist with finding materials from projects they worked on in the past. By creating a project manager that includes descriptions, references, and categorical tags it could assist academics refer back to sources of previous work. And from their ‘project completion list’ the portfolio assistant could create activity reports and possibly even a CV.

There are plenty of task managers and academic activity products out there, but not many that do both and those that do exist can be expensive or specialized for a specific field of study. The goal of this product would be a basic universal version that could be used by all students and steadily added on to include the entire life-cycle of an academic or research professional.

To start out with the base product, the structure will likely look like a typical task management product. However, we are looking to add features that allow the user to keep track of the sources of information they use and structure the data in a manner that is consistent with industry reporting standards.

An example of how this would work: A graduate student is working on a project researching how to create a computer vision model that creates a topological map from an observation drone. During the semester the student uses a wide variety of sources and individuals to learn about the best practices to do this. While the student uses our product to manage tasks needed for the project, they also track all of the source references and contacts for the experts they reached out for advice. Along with having the source references and contacts for these projects, it will also allow for tagging of the subject on that project. So the above graduate student could tag this project as pertaining to the primary study of ‘Computer modeling’ or ‘Artificial Intelligence’ with an additional tag of ‘Geography’.

A couple years later the student is now graduating and needs to work on their resume.  The aim is to allow for the new graduate to be able to pull a report on the projects they’ve worked on and have descriptions on what they did. Or following getting a job with a research institute as a research assistant they get assigned to a geospatial project in which they are using drones to track the water run-off effect on the environment around key waterways. Remembering that they had worked on a similar project in the past, the student could use their academic activity portfolio to quickly find the project they worked on in the previous paragraph.  From there they can easily gather their sources and contact information from working on this project in the past and use it as a baseline to further development.  Additionally if the person continues to use the product in their professional life, they may be able to use it for their annual performance evaluations by having a quick and easy report that has been managed over the year as they worked on projects.

One of the hardest things in academia is keeping track of all the information and contacts you work with over time on various projects. Let us help make it easier for you.
